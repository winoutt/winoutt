Two principal varieties are used, the small-leaved China plant (C. sinensis sinensis) and the large-leaved Assam plant (C. sinensis assamica). Hybrids of these two varieties are also grown. The leaves may be fermented or left unfermented.</p><p>The latest edition of Andy Bell’s Piccalilli landed in my inbox this morning with a sweet offer: preorder Andy’s course on learning Eleventy from scratch at a third of the price.</p><p>Why the plug? No, not sponsorships or anything like that. I just happen to hear a heckuva lot about Eleventy these days. Like how we can use it with Google Sheets as a pseudo-CMS. Or how it can be a key component of an emergency website kit.</p><p><img src="https://placeimg.com/500/240/any"></p><p>COLOMBO, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankas Meteorology Department on Tuesday warned of extreme heat in several districts of the island country as the sun is expected to be directly over Sri Lanka on April 7-15.
